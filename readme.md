A program to declutter your downloads folder:

1. Gives you a summary of your downloads folder 
2. Creates folders depending on the types of files available in your downloads folder
3. Moves all the files to the respective folders
For example if you have a pdf file named example1.pdf and excel file named example2.xls after executing this program the pdf file will be moved to pdf_folder and excel file will be moved to xls_folder. So try it out :)
